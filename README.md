# proj.ai-backend

## Why Express?
- The primary reason I chose Express was to gain hands-on experience with it.
- Additionally, Express is a straightforward and lightweight framework, making it easy to learn and allowing me to deploy my backend quickly.

## Why Add TypeScript?
- Simply put, TypeScript makes debugging easier and improves the reliability and safety of the application.
- I also implemented it based on a recommendation from one of the Staff Engineers at RBC.

## Running Locally
- Install all dependencies: `npm install`.
- To run the backend in development mode: `npx tsx src/index.ts`.
- To run the production version:
```sh
npm install && npx tsc
node dist/index.js
```
